# Rye-centromere pipelines

**Code for:** *High-resolution genome assembly reveals retrotransposon-mediated centromere dynamics in rye*  
**Purpose:** shell pipelines to reproduce the core computational steps (assembly → scaffolding → annotation → ssDRIP-seq processing → repeat/retrotransposon phylogeny).  
**Status:** enables **initial reproduction** of the main analyses，including the plotting scripts (R) for figures.

**License:** MIT (OSI-approved) — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
